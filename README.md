### Pleasure to meet you! I'm a student programmer working on web-based applications and web programming.👋

I've always loved computers and the things they could do. Mainly game design and game development interest me more than anything. I'll always be ranting about new technologies I'm obsessed about and you'll find me wandering with my camera trying to see the world in an interesting manner.

<h4>📖 Current Obsessions: <i>Godot, Vue, and Flutter</i></h4>
